Git Clone: Creating a copy of selected repository in local computer 
 * If you don’t have the permissions to make changes to it, 
   your push attempt will be rejected by the remote. 
   Otherwise, your changes will be directly integrated into the repository when you push.
 * There is no git fork command. 

Git Fork: Creating a copy of selected repository in your git server

   If you want, afterwards, you can create a pull request to integrate your changes to the original repository.
